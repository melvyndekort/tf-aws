- **Security groups** and network ACLs for traffic control
- **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint** for secure SSH access
- **Regional restrictions** preventing resource creation outside EU-West-1

### ☁️ Compute & Container Services
- **ECS Fargate cluster** with spot instance support
- **CloudWatch logging** with KMS encryption
- **Execute command configuration** for secure container access
- **Capacity providers** for cost optimization

### 📦 Storage & Data Management
- **S3 buckets** for Terraform state, Lambda functions, and access logs
- **Versioning and lifecycle policies** for cost optimization
- **Server-side encryption** with customer-managed KMS keys
- **Public access blocking** for security compliance

### 🔧 API & Web Services
- **API Gateway** with custom domain and SSL certificates
- **CloudFront functions** for request processing
- **ACM certificates** with automated DNS validation
- **Cloudflare integration** for DNS management and CDN

### 🤖 Automation & CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for automated Terraform deployment
- **OIDC authentication** for secure AWS access from GitHub
- **Automated planning and applying** on main branch pushes
- **Pull request validation** with plan output comments
- **Dependabot integration** for dependency updates

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **CloudWatch log groups** with retention policies
- **VPC Flow Logs** capability (configurable)
- **Athena integration** for log analysis
- **Access logging** for S3 and other services

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Terraform** ~> 1.6.0
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate permissions
- **Cloudflare account** with API token access
- **YubiKey** with PIV certificate (for Roles Anywhere)
- **PGP key** for password encryption

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tf-aws
```

### 2. Configure Variables
Update `terraform.tfvars` with your specific values:
```hcl
account_id = "your-aws-account-id"
region     = "eu-west-1"
pgp_key    = "your-pgp-public-key"
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### 4. Plan and Apply
```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Network Configuration
- **VPC CIDR**: 172.16.0.0/16
- **Private Subnets**: 172.16.101-103.0/24
- **Public Subnets**: 172.16.111-113.0/24
- **IPv6**: Enabled with automatic assignment
- **Availability Zones**: eu-west-1a, eu-west-1b, eu-west-1c

### Security Features
- **Password Policy**: 40+ character minimum, 89-day rotation
- **MFA Required**: All role assumptions require MFA
- **KMS Encryption**: All data encrypted with customer-managed keys
- **Regional Restrictions**: EC2 resources limited to EU-West-1

### User Management
